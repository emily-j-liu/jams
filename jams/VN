# EXAMPLE TITLE, 3D Scanning and Integration: Bringing Real Objects into A-Frame Virtual Reality Worlds

### Details:
_Outcome:_ Create your own A-Frame world that incorporates an object, person, or entire room scanned by a mobile app

_Requirements:_ iOS or Android Phone (for scanning), Replit Access

_Language used:_ A-Frame

_Customization opportunity:_ Scan any object, person, or room you'd like and create your own A-Frame world around that object. You could also include multiple objects/people/rooms. Each world created is different and can have a level of complexity decided by the Jammer. 

_Platform Limitations:_ Browser-based Replit Development, so available on all platforms (+ App available on both iOS and Android)

_Time estimation:_ 1 Hour 

### Breakdown
- Set up: Fork a replit starter with necessary materials
- Part 1: Building out front end of the website with an input bar and button
- Part 2: Set up free google search API
- Part 3: Write JavaScript to display results from API on the page
- Success!!! Now you've got a search engine!

**Make sure your proposal (similar to the one above) answer these questions about your Jam idea:**
- How will you ensure that every outcome of the workshop varies (i.e. how will you give jammers a sense of ownership over their project)? 
- Why should Hack Clubbers care about this project?
- General outline of a club meet doing the Jam
- What Club Members will walk away with (both in terms of knowledge and in terms of product)
- What makes this workshop fun or interesting for Club Members?
- What platforms will be supported (i.e. MacOS, Windows, Chromebook, Mobile, Browser, etc)?
- How will you allow Club Leaders to add their own project to the Jam presentation (giving them a sense of ownership over the meeting)?
