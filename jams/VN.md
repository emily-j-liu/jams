### Questions
**How will you ensure that every outcome of the workshop varies (i.e. how will you give jammers a sense of ownership over their project)?**

Jammers have free reign to choose what kind of storyline they wish to create, and what genre the story falls under. They can create their own unique story with new characters, sprites, and varying levels of complexity.

**Why should Hack Clubbers care about this project?**

Renpy is a simple but powerful allowing Jammers to quickly create a simple visual novel, while also giving them the ability to add on more layers of complexity with additional Python knowledge.

**What Club Members will walk away with (both in terms of knowledge and in terms of product)**

An understanding of how Renpy works, an understanding of how to put together a basic visual novel using Renpy, and a simple visual novel that they created.

**What makes this workshop fun or interesting for Club Members?**

They can create a game that is able to tell a story of any genre, from comedic games to horror ones.

**How will you allow Club Leaders to add their own project to the Jam presentation (giving them a sense of ownership over the meeting)?**

Club Leaders can demo a short visual novel that they've created, showing club members an example of what Renpy is able to do.
